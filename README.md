# CSP_MiniSolver

This repository presents a collaborative work by Arthur Divanovic and Axel Navarro.

The aim of the project is to implement a generic CSP solver with binary constraints and integer variables. The domains of the variables will be finite. The structure allows to model and solve such a CSP. Several consistency methods are also implemented. The performances of the solver are assessed on small problems.
